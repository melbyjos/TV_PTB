# TV_PTB
This repository contains various experiments computing the SU(2) version of the Turaev-Viro
invariants of circle bundles over the once-punctured torus.

These notebooks contain a couple different implementations of algorithms for computing the
Turaev-Viro invariants of the punctured torus bundles. One implementation uses the original
definition of the invariant defined on a triangulation of the hyperbolic 3-manifold corresponding to
each bundle, and the other implementation is a more efficient recursive formulation of the
invariants from the perspective of quantum representations of the mapping class group of the
punctured torus. 

While these notebooks are not associated to any published research, their underlying theory is
studied in the dissertation of Dr. Sanjay Kumar from MSU in 2021, where he gives a closed formula
for the Turaev-Viro invariants of these manifolds, as well as in an informal collaborative research
project between Sanjay and myself.

The code included here was written in part by both of us.
